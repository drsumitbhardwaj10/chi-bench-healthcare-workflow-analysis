## What this benchmark measures

$\chi$-Bench evaluates AI agents on end-to-end U.S. healthcare workflows across three long-horizon domains: provider prior authorization, payer utilization management, and population care management. Each task hands the agent a clinical case in a high-fidelity simulator of 20 healthcare apps exposed over MCP, with a 1,279-document Managed-Care Operations Handbook skills, and asks it to drive the case through tool calls and artifact authoring.

| Domain                               | Tasks | What the agent does                                                                                        |
| ------------------------------------ | ----- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Prior Authorization — Provider**   | 25    | Verify coverage, gather evidence, submit the PA packet, work the response (RFIs, peer-to-peer, appeals)    |
| **Prior Authorization — UM (Payer)** | 25    | Intake the request, check plan policy, escalate through nurse and physician reviewers, issue determination |
| **Care Management**                  | 25    | Review the chart, contact the patient, administer assessments, author a care plan                          |

## Setup (one-time)

**Prereqs:** Python 3.12+, Docker, [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv).

**1. Clone and install.**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/actava-ai/chi-bench && cd chi-bench
uv sync --extra dev
```

**2. API keys.** Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in:

- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` — **required**. The workspace judge (`claude-opus-4-7`) grades every trial; also the default credential for the Claude Code agent harness.
- `OPENAI_API_KEY` — required for Codex and OAI Agents rows.
- `GEMINI_API_KEY` — required for Gemini CLI rows.
- `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` — required for the open-stack rows (Hermes / OpenClaw / OAI Agents / DeepAgents on open-weight models).
- `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` — _optional_, cheaper alternative for smoke-testing the Claude Code harness. When set, Claude Code authenticates via OAuth instead of `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`.

Provide whichever provider keys you need for the rows you intend to run. Hugging Face and Modal credentials are handled by their respective CLIs (see steps 3 and the Modal note below) — no tokens go in `.env`.

**3. Task fixtures from Hugging Face.** Authenticate once with the CLI, then download the gated dataset:

```bash
uv run huggingface-cli login

REV=chi-bench-v1.0.0
uv run huggingface-cli download actava/chi-bench --repo-type dataset --revision "$REV" --local-dir data/
echo "$REV" > data/.chi-bench-version
```

The `data/.chi-bench-version` pin is what submission preflight verifies against your config's `dataset.version`; write it whenever you change revisions.

**4. Managed-Care Operations Handbook (gated, request access).**

The handbook (1,279 markdown documents) is distributed separately as the **gated** Hugging Face dataset **[actava/managed-care-operations-handbook](https://huggingface.co/datasets/actava/managed-care-operations-handbook)** (size + curation provenance with clinical collaborators). Request access on that repo's page; once approved, download it into `data/skills/` with your HF token:

```bash
uv run huggingface-cli download actava/managed-care-operations-handbook \
    --repo-type dataset --local-dir data/skills/
# -> data/skills/managed-care-operations-handbook/{SKILL.md,references/}
```

**5. Build the Docker image** (~5 min, one-time).

```bash
uv run cb docker build
```

> [!NOTE]
> `cb` is the short alias for `chi-bench`; both commands resolve to the same CLI. Pick whichever you prefer (the rest of this README uses `cb`). If your shell already aliases `cb` to something else (e.g. a clipboard tool), use `chi-bench`. For the full command surface and flag reference, read [`docs/cli.md`](docs/cli.md).

The image bundles the FastAPI server, the workspace judge, the agent harness, and per-task fixtures.

**Verify setup:**

```bash
uv run cb data verify
```

A clean run means you're ready for the quickstart.

> [!TIP]
> **Modal (optional, recommended).** Modal parallelizes trials across remote sandboxes. Set it up now and you won't have to later:
>
> ```bash
> uv run modal setup                            # default profile, or:
> uv run modal token set --profile chi-bench    # (optional) named profile
> ```
>
> If you use a named profile, export `MODAL_PROFILE=chi-bench` in your shell before running the matrix.

## Quickstart: run one task

Smoke-test that everything is wired up with a single UM medical-director-review task:

```bash
uv run cb experiment run \
  --dataset data/prior_auth_um/tasks/pa_t008_t008_o002_p01_mdreview_payer \
  --agent codex --model openai/gpt-5.5
```

Trial output lands under `logs/experiments/.../trial_*/`. Read `result.json` for the verifier reward and `verifier/scorecard.json` for per-check verdicts.

Full flag-by-flag CLI reference: [`docs/cli.md`](docs/cli.md). Web walkthrough of the same flow: **[actava.ai/benchmarks/docs/quickstart](https://actava.ai/benchmarks/docs/quickstart)**.

## Run from the Harbor hub (no source checkout)

chi-Bench is also published to the [Harbor hub](https://hub.harborframework.com/datasets/actava-ai/chi-bench) as `actava-ai/chi-bench` — **78 single-agent tasks** (75 single-domain + 3 marathon). Each task ships a self-contained Dockerfile that Harbor builds on demand — cloning this repo and downloading the [fixtures dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/actava/chi-bench) at build — so you can run a trial without cloning anything yourself.

> **The 23 provider↔payer E2E tasks are *not* on the Harbor hub.** The E2E arena needs the two-agent `dual-pa-e2e` harness (provider phase → relay → payer phase), which a stock single-agent `harbor run` can't drive. Run E2E from this repo / the [HF dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/actava/chi-bench) with the `cb` CLI: `cb experiment run --dataset data/prior_auth_e2e/tasks/<id> --agent dual-pa-e2e --provider-model … --payer-model …` (see [`configs/experiments/table2_e2e_arena.yaml`](configs/experiments/table2_e2e_arena.yaml)).

**Prerequisites:** Docker + the [Harbor CLI](https://github.com/harbor-framework/harbor), and an **approved HF token** for the gated [handbook](https://huggingface.co/datasets/actava/managed-care-operations-handbook) (the container downloads it at start; the fixtures dataset itself is public).

```bash
HF_TOKEN=<your-approved-hf-token> harbor run \
    -d actava-ai/chi-bench@v1.0.1 \
    -i actava-ai/pa_t016_t016_o001_p01_p2p_payer \
    -a claude-code -m claude-opus-4-7 -y
```

`HF_TOKEN` is read from your shell (or `--env-file`) and forwarded into the container — `-y` auto-confirms that prompt. Drop `-i …` to run all 78 tasks. Without an approved token the container exits early with a clear message. See [`docs/harbor-hub.md`](docs/harbor-hub.md) for how the fetch-at-build environment works and how the listing is regenerated/published. This path is for ad-hoc runs and discovery; the **paper-reproduction and leaderboard-submission flows use the `cb` CLI** described above.

### Reading the verifier output

Each trial's `verifier/` directory has three files: `reward.json` (the single binary `{"reward": 0.0 | 1.0}` used for pass@1), `scorecard.json` (per-check breakdown — read this to see _why_ a trial passed or failed), and `exported_state.json` (the world snapshot the verifier scored against).

`scorecard.json` carries two reward axes: **`binary_reward`** (strict — `1.0` only when every non-N/A check passes; this is what the leaderboard publishes) and **`fractional_reward = passed_checks / total_checks`** (partial credit for diagnostics; never published). A `0.0 / 0.91` split means a near-miss. Checks are grouped under `stages` (`md_review`, `outcome`, `cross_stage`, `intake`, `nurse_review`, `p2p`, `appeal`, `provider_*`, `cm_*`, `e2e_consistency`); `failed_checks` lists what broke.

> [!TIP]
> Field-by-field walkthrough — including check-name namespaces, the `judge.*` LLM rubric format, three check states, the Care Management two-axis schema, a worked example, and `cb verifier rejudge` — lives at **[actava.ai/benchmarks/docs/scorecard](https://actava.ai/benchmarks/docs/scorecard)**.

If you see a scorecard, you're ready to [submit your agent](#submit-your-agent) or [reproduce the paper](#reproduce-paper-tables).

## Submit your agent

> [!TIP]
> **Bringing your own agent harness or model endpoint?** The end-to-end recipe lives in [`docs/extending.md`](docs/extending.md) and on the web at **[actava.ai/benchmarks/docs/extending](https://actava.ai/benchmarks/docs/extending)**. The rest of this section is identical regardless of whether you submit a built-in agent or a custom one — the packet shape is unchanged.

Submitting to the [leaderboard](https://github.com/actava-ai/leaderboard) is a 5-command flow: 4 against chi-bench (validate, run, status, prepare) and the final step against the leaderboard repo (commit + open PR). Prefer reading on the web? See the **[in-app submission walkthrough](https://actava.ai/benchmarks/submit)** for the same flow with collapsible step UI.

**1. Configure.** Copy `configs/submission_example.yaml` to `configs/submissions/<your-id>.yaml` and edit `id`, `team`, `contact`, `agent`, `model`; optionally `notes` and `run.*`.

**2. Run trials and prepare a packet.**

```bash
# Schema + preflight: dataset pin, Modal token / Docker image, agent name.
uv run cb submission validate -f configs/submissions/<your-id>.yaml

# Run all 3 domains. Default: one trial per task (pass@1).
uv run cb submission run      -f configs/submissions/<your-id>.yaml

# Check progress; safe to run while `submission run` is in flight.
uv run cb submission status   -f configs/submissions/<your-id>.yaml

# Curate the leaderboard-ready packet (a directory you `cp` into the leaderboard repo).
uv run cb submission prepare  -f configs/submissions/<your-id>.yaml
```

The final command writes to `logs/submissions/<id>/packet/YYYY-MM-DD-<id>/`, containing:

```
submission.json                # manifest: agent, model, results, provenance
results.csv                    # leaderboard rows (one per domain + overall)
sub.yaml                       # frozen copy of your config
provenance.json                # git SHA, image digest, timestamps
README.md                      # auto-generated headline summary
trials/<domain>/<trial_id>/
    result.json                # Harbor reward + agent metadata
    verifier/scorecard.json    # per-check verdicts
    verifier/reward.json       # verifier's reward breakdown
    agent/trajectory.jsonl.zst # full agent trace (zstd-compressed; inspect with `zstdcat | jq .`)
```

Workspace artifacts and Harbor scratch files are deliberately excluded so the packet stays small (typically <100 MB total).

**3. Submit the packet.** Follow the instructions at **<https://github.com/actava-ai/leaderboard>** — either the one-command helper (`python scripts/submit.py <packet-path>`) or the manual `cp` + `git` + `gh pr create` flow. Either way, the packet is identical; the leaderboard repo owns the submission workflow.

Packet contract (for benchmark authors building their own producers): [`docs/submission-packet.md`](docs/submission-packet.md).

**Policy notes.**

- **Partial submissions** (`--domain pa | um | cm` on `submission run`) are accepted but flagged as partial on the leaderboard.
- **Leaderboard is pass@1 only.** Set `run.n_attempts: 3` to keep extra trials on disk for your own pass@3 / pass^3 analysis — the manifest still publishes pass@1.

## Reproduce paper tables

| Result                           | Config                       | Command                         |
| -------------------------------- | ---------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Main matrix (paper Table 2)      | `table1_main_matrix.yaml`    | `./scripts/run_table.sh table1` |
| E2E arena (paper Table 3)        | `table2_e2e_arena.yaml`      | `./scripts/run_table.sh table2` |
| Marathon (paper Table 4)         | `table3_marathon.yaml`       | `./scripts/run_table.sh table3` |
| Skill ablation (paper Figure 12) | `table4_skill_ablation.yaml` | `./scripts/run_table.sh table4` |
| MCP vs CLI (paper Table 5)       | `table5_mcp_vs_cli.yaml`     | `./scripts/run_table.sh table5` |

After all slices finish, aggregate:

```bash
uv run python scripts/aggregate.py \
  --trials-dir logs/experiments/table1_main_matrix \
  --prices configs/prices.yaml \
  --out-csv logs/table1.csv
```

CSV columns: `agent, model, n_trials, n_tasks, pass_at_1, pass_at_1_lo, pass_at_1_hi, pass_at_3, ..., pass_pow_3, pass_pow_3_hi, mean_cost_usd, mean_walltime_s` with task-level percentile bootstrap 95% CIs (1,000 iterations, seed `0` — matches paper Table 2 / Figure 3 captions; override with `--bootstrap-iters` / `--bootstrap-seed`). v1 emits the numeric tables; paper figures are out of scope — plot from the CSV. See [`docs/reproduce.md`](docs/reproduce.md) for the figure scripts we used.

> [!TIP]
> Add `--modal` to `run_table.sh` for parallel execution on Modal — matrix reproduction on a single host takes days.

## Architecture

A single Python package (`chi_bench`) hosts a FastAPI server, three MCP servers (provider :8020, payer :8100, CM :8200), and an LLM-based workspace judge. Each trial runs in a fresh Docker container that bundles the server, the judge, the agent harness, and the per-task fixtures. The Managed-Care Operations Handbook (1,279 markdown documents) is mounted into the agent's skill directory at trial start.

## Analytical Workflow Study

This repository also contains a structured analysis of CHI-Bench task design, developed independently as part of a healthcare analytics portfolio.

The analysis covers three workflow perspectives:

| Analysis | Coverage | Focus |
|---|---:|---|
| Provider Prior Authorization | 25 workflows | Condition diversity and policy-reference complexity |
| Payer Utilization Management | 25 workflows | Workflow stages, documentation volume, and policy complexity |
| Care Management | 25 workflows | Engagement scenarios, condition diversity, and workflow structure |

### Analysis artifacts

- `analysis/notebooks/` — reproducible Jupyter analyses
- `analysis/data/` — derived task-level metadata
- `analysis/figures/` — analytical visualizations
- `analysis/reports/` — written findings
- `analysis/scripts/` — metadata extraction scripts

The analysis focuses on benchmark structure and workflow characteristics. It does not use hidden evaluation artifacts and does not present benchmark task composition as real-world clinical prevalence or patient behavior.
